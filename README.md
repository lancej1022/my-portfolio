# This is the source code for my homepage at https://lancejeffers.com

Lovingly crafted with React, TypeScript, and Next.js I decided to leave it publicly viewable in case anyone was curious about how I approached constructing my portfolio. Many of the interesting CSS effects on my page were copied from other developers before me (who probably copied it from other developers before them), so I figured I would "pay it forward" by keeping the code for this portfolio public.

While I certainly don't mind you borrowing ideas or seeing how I implemented certain features, I do ask that you don't actually copy large sections of the website -- I'd suggest creating your own website from scratch since it helps you reinforce coding concepts, and simply use this code as a reference for certain pieces.

## If you want to launch a copy

```
git clone https://github.com/lancej1022/my-portfolio.git
npm i
npm run dev
```

Have fun and remember to make the website your own. Choose new colors, create new CSS effects, whatever expresses _your_ skills as a developer.

## Useful Resources

- The [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) are easily some of the best docs I've ever read through. You can tell the team is seriously passionate about doing things right, and its part of the reason Next.js has become my default platform for building new React apps.
- The [Styled Components docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) are useful if you're interested in CSS-in-JS. If you've never tried it before, I highly recommend it.
- The [Next Serverless plugin](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-next.js) is great if you want to launch your Next app on AWS.

### To-do List:

While I'm pretty happy with the page so far, I also know that I can do better once I'm not so bogged down with other work.

I plan to implement a blog, spice up the styling a bit, and fix one small bug (shout out to David H for bringing it to my attention). So if you do decide to clone the page, keep in mind that its far from finished and so you should try to add some of your own flare.
