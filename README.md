This is the code for my homepage at https://lancejeffers.com

Lovingly crafted with React, TypeScript, and Next.js I decided to leave it publicly viewable in case anyone was curious about how I approached constructing my portfolio. Many of the interesting CSS effects on my page were copied from other developers before me (who probably copied it from other developers before them), so I figured I would "pay it forward" by keeping the code for this portfolio public.

While I certainly don't mind you borrowing ideas or seeing how I implemented certain features, I do ask that you don't actually copy large sections of the website -- I'd suggest creating your own website from scratch since it helps you reinforce coding concepts, and simply use this code as a reference for certain pieces.

Testing is done using Jest (shout out to Kent Dodds for his TestingJavaScript course). Website is deployed to AWS. Always happy to nerd out on any technologies used in this app.
